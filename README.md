This is the repository for the Digital Sky Implementation of the Ardupilot. This is a community effort to ensure that the ardupilot project is modified to meet the technical requirements as outlined in the [DGCA RPAS guidance manual](http://www.dgca.nic.in/rpas/DGCA%20RPAS%20Guidance%20Manual.pdf). This is in line with the new Drone regulations in India that was released under the [Civil Aviation Requirements - Section 3,  Series X, Part 1](http://dgca.nic.in/cars/D3X-X1.pdf) Concerning the operation of UAS in India. 

Let's make Ardupilot compliant in India by working together and fulfilling the vision of the Digital Sky.
